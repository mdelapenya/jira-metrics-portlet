# JIRA Metrics Portlet

## Motivation

More and more often, development teams managers need to monitor current status of their projects based on some metrics defined by themselves.

JIRA is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian, used for bug tracking, issue tracking and project management.

As JIRA provides many metrics by itself, we've decided to start a [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com) + [AlloyUI](http://www.alloyui.com) + [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) integration portlet that allows to display some customized metrics in an easy and portal-deployable way. For that, a Liferay portal Admin, can deploy this portlet in his/her portal, allowing its users to watch metrics and stats defined, in an user-friendly style, using AlloyUI built-in cappabilities.

## Configuration

Placeholder for configuration

## Testing

For testing purpose, we are using [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org), which builds the plugin and deploys it to the server. retrieving test results to the test client that executed the tests (console or IDE). If you want to configure this, you must:

- Comment the restriction of the ant version in **build-common.xml** from plugins SDK.
>* Original Code
```
if>
	<not>
    	<equals arg1="${correct.ant.version}" arg2="true" />
    </not>
    <then>
        <fail>Please use Ant 1.7.0 or above.</fail>
    </then>
</if>
```
>* New Code
```
<!--<if>
    <not>
        <equals arg1="${correct.ant.version}" arg2="true" />
    </not>
     <then>
         <fail>Please use Ant 1.7.0 or above.</fail>
     </then>
</if>-->
```

- Change **build-common-ivy.xml**  from plugins SDK, enabling IVY to download transitive dependencies.

>* Original Code
```
<ivy:resolve
    file="@{ivy.xml.dir}/ivy.xml"
    log="download-only"
    transitive="false"
/>
```
>* New Code
```
<ivy:resolve
    file="@{ivy.xml.dir}/ivy.xml"
    log="download-only"
    transitive="true"
/>
```

- Change **build-common-plugin.xml** from plugins SDK, more concretely the 'test-cmd' target, removing the 'dir' attribute.

>* Original Code
```
<target name="test-cmd">
                <if>
                        <available file="test/${test.type}" type="dir" />
                        <then>
                                <junit dir="${sdk.dir}" fork="on" forkmode="${junit.forkmode}" outputtoformatters="false" printsummary="on" showoutput="true">
                                        ...
                                </junit>
                        </then>
                </if>
        </target>
```
>* New Code
```
<target name="test-cmd">
                <if>
                        <available file="test/${test.type}" type="dir" />
                        <then>
                                <junit fork="on" forkmode="${junit.forkmode}" outputtoformatters="false" printsummary="on" showoutput="true">
                                        ...
                                </junit>
                        </then>
                </if>
        </target>
```

- Compile the project, so that IVY downloads all the dependencies.
- Make your test classes extend BaseArquillianTestCase, base test class that performs all the 'magic' to build the plugin and deploys to a remote server
